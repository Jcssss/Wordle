# Wordle Unlimited
A replica of the New York Times' game Wordle. This project was programed using React JS and was the first time I used React JS in a project. While working on the project, I learned about props, state and other core aspects of the language.

The web-app is currently hosted using github-pages, to access it, simply click on this link: [Wordle Unlimited](https://Jcssss.github.io/Wordle)

## How to Play:

### Controls:
To input words, type using your keyboard or use the digital keyboard on the web-page. Only letters are allowed. Press backspace to remove a letter or enter to submit your word.

### Rules:
You have 6 attempts to guess a randomly "chosen" 5 letter word. Each turn you will input one valid 5 letter word. The app will then give a response, if a letter's box is green, then the respective letter is in the final word and is in the correct position. If a letter's box is yellow, then the respective letter is in the final word, but is not in the correct position. Finally, if a letter's box is grey, then the respective letter is not in the final word. Remember, you only have 6 guesses, so make them count! Good luck :)
